                <h2>This is Cable Mangling!</h2>
                <p>Cable mangling is the act of using brute force and sheer determination to tame unruly cables, much
                    like a lion tamer tames a wild lion. It involves wrangling cables into submission, bending them to
                    your will, and forcing them to behave in a manner that is both aesthetically pleasing and
                    functional. </p>

                    <h3>Cable ties</h3>
                    <p>Cable ties, also known as zip ties or tie wraps, are thin, flexible strips of plastic or nylon
                        that are used to bind, secure, and organize cables and wires. They are designed with a
                        self-locking mechanism, which allows them to be tightened and secured around cables by simply
                        pulling on one end of the tie. Cable ties are typically used to keep cables organized and in
                        place, and can be used in a wide range of applications, including home wiring, automotive
                        wiring, and in industrial settings. Cable ties are often used in conjunction with other tools
                        and accessories, such as cable tie mounts, which provide a secure attachment point for the ties.

                    <h3>Duct tape</h3>
                    <p>Duct tape is a type of strong, flexible adhesive tape that is used for a wide range of purposes,
                        including sealing, binding, and reinforcing. It is made from a backing material coated with a
                        strong, pressure-sensitive adhesive, which allows it to stick to a variety of surfaces. Duct
                        tape is known for its durability and versatility, and is often used for repairs, especially in
                        emergency situations. It is also used for crafts, such as making wallets, flowers, and other
                        objects. Duct tape is made in a range of colors and patterns, and is often used in combination
                        with other tools and materials.

                    <h3>Cable cutter</h3>
                    <p>A cable cutter is a hand-held tool used to cut through cables, wires, and other types of
                        materials. Cable cutters come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be used for a wide range
                        of applications, including cutting electrical cables, coaxial cables, and telephone cables.
                        Cable cutters are typically designed with a sharp, serrated edge that is capable of cutting
                        through tough materials, and may also have a built-in wire stripper for removing the insulation
                        from wires. Cable cutters may be manual or powered, and may be used by hand or mounted on a
                        machine. They are an essential tool for electricians, technicians, and other professionals who
                        work with cables and wires.

                        Cables are essential components of many modern technologies, allowing us to connect devices and
                        transmit information over long distances. However, these cables can be prone to mangling and
                        damage, particularly when they are handled or moved frequently. Cable mangling can result in
                        broken signals and disrupted connections, which can be frustrating and costly to repair.

                        The proliferation of connected devices has led to an increase in the number of cables being
                        used, resulting in a seemingly infinite tangle of wires. This can make it difficult to keep
                        track of which cables are responsible for which connections, and can result in confusion and
                        frustration when trying to troubleshoot problems.

                        Despite the challenges posed by cables and their susceptibility to damage, the advances in
                        artificial intelligence (AI) are helping to mitigate these issues. AI-powered systems can
                        automatically detect and diagnose problems with cables and connections, and even make repairs
                        without human intervention. This is helping to reduce downtime and improve the reliability of
                        our connected devices.

                        As AI continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more sophisticated systems for
                        managing and repairing cables and connections. This could lead to a future where the problems
                        posed by broken signals and disrupted connections are a thing of the past, thanks to the power
                        of artificial intelligence. Overall, the integration of AI into our daily lives is helping to
                        make our connected world more efficient and reliable.
